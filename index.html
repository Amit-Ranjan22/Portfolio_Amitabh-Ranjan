                    Though I am relatively new to this field, I confess its really my "renaissance." Having worked in so
                    many different profiles all these years, from being an analyst with an investment bank, associate
                    admin with tortilla manufacturing company,to being an entrant in the IT field now, I think I have
                    finally found my calling. Throughout my past jobs, there is one innate skill, in particular, about
                    which I have been constantly been made aware of and that is is my meticulousness. I believe its a
                    happy marriage of my being meticulous with programming and the love for web development has started
                    to blossom as a result.

                    Though the COVID-19 pandemic has been a nightmare for majority of the world, I salvaged an
                    opportunity to begin a sojourn that first saw me passing the ASTQB foundation level exam in June
                    2020 and then the ASTQB Agile test- all on a self-learned basis. But the quench had just started to
                    unfold and so I started learning programming on my own but then realized that I had to break this
                    solitude of self-learning. The idea of -enrolling in a bootcamp was challenging at first but I
                    decided to take the plunge because I needed to streamline my efforts at self-learning. And have
                    never failed to cherish and relish every bit of knowledge gained and assignments undertaken so far.
                    My penchant for singing also helps me to get through the rough moments and I realize I am singing
                    for myself so much these days!
